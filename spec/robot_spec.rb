# Manage robot factory settings.

# When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name.

# The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated in the format of
# two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.

# Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which
# means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it will respond with
# a new random name.

# The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.
# Random names means a risk of collisions. Your solution should not allow the
# use of the same name twice when avoidable. In some exercism language tracks
# there are tests to ensure that the same name is never used twice.
